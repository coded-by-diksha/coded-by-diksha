🌱 A passionate Flutter front-end developer and bachelor's student, currently focused on crafting intuitive mobile applications that blend modern UI/UX with practical backend integration.


🎓 I'm pursuing my Bachelor's degree (2nd year), and already diving deep into real-world projects like food delivery, client-chef bookings, and smart home interfaces.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🚀 **Flutter Development** – I love building sleek, responsive apps with clean architecture and meaningful design.
- 🛠️ **Backend Integration** – Working with Django and PostgreSQL to power features like booking systems, authentication, and real-time messaging.
- 📡 **API Integration** – Consuming RESTful APIs and managing data flow between front-end and back-end.
- 🔒 **Security Practices** – Implementing password hashing and validation for secure user handling.
- 🧠 **Learning Daily** – Currently leveling up my skills in Flutter, advanced UI design, and efficient state management.

## 🧩 Projects I've Worked On

- 👩‍🍳 **Chef-Client Booking App**  
  A Flutter app where clients find nearby chefs, book appointments, and chat—like Uber, but for home-cooked meals.  
  > Integrated with Django backend, PostgreSQL DB, Firebase Auth, and live location features.

- 🍲 **Food Ordering App**  
  Designed a menu UI with curved dotted lines and cart management features—data fetched dynamically from a backend API.

- 📊 **NYC 311 Data Analysis**  
  Used Python for wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing customer service request data as part of a coursework assignment.
